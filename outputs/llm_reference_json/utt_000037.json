  "input": "But I want to convert this to radians. I'm going to use this ratio. Again, I'm allowed to multiply by 1 because I'm not technically changing it. I'm just doing it creatively. So the thing to keep in mind is which of these two forms are we going to use? Well, I've got degrees on top. I want to get rid of degrees and end up with radians. So what do I got to do? I have to put the degrees on the bottom.",
  "offline_reference": "但我希望将其转换为弧度，我将使用这个比例关系，再次强调，我可以乘以1，因为实际上并没有改变数值，我只是创造性地进行变换，关键是要记住应该使用这两种形式中的哪一种：因为我上面有度数，而我希望消除度数并最终得到弧度，所以我必须把度数放在分母上。"
