  "input": "You can represent an angle with either one, they're just two different ways of measuring it. Two different scales. But we want to be able to go back and forth between them. You might start off with degrees and want radians or vice versa. So it's important to know how to convert.",
  "offline_reference": "你可以用两种方式中的任意一种来表示一个角，它们只是测量角度的两种不同方法和尺度，但我们需要能够在这两者之间自由转换，因为你可能从度数开始，需要换算成弧度，或者反过来，因此掌握换算方法非常重要。"
