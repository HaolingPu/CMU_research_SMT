  "input": "You might have something like 1.67. Well, 1.67 radians, we can still convert this to degrees. We still do the same method. It's still, oh, I want to cancel out radians, so put pi on the bottom. Put the radians on the bottom. 180 still goes on top. It's just, now we multiply this through.",
  "offline_reference": "你可能会得到像1.67这样的数值，嗯，1.67弧度，我们仍然可以将其转换为角度，方法依然相同，还是想约掉弧度，所以把π放在分母，弧度放在分母，180仍放在分子，只是现在要将这个式子相乘。"
