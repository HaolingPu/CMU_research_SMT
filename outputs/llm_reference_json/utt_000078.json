  "input": "Like you think, I have never been on a road as bad as this one off-ramp from the highway where you had to take it so slow because it had potholes and there were two guys there in this small bucket and a couple of shovels. It was hopeless. They needed so much bigger machinery to fix this road. But we managed to take our suburban and a driver, well, hired a driver with a suburban, and he took us to these small towns. The wildlife was really cool.",
  "offline_reference": "正如你所想，我从未见过如此糟糕的高速公路出口匝道，路况极差，坑洼遍布，仅靠两个男人坐在一个小桶里，拿着几把铁锹徒手修补，简直毫无希望，修复这条道路需要更大型的机械设备才行；但我们还是设法租了一辆郊区车和一名司机，他开着这辆车带我们驶向那些小城镇，沿途的野生动物真是令人惊叹。"
