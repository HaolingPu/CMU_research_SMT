  "input": "a lot of lizards and iguanas and some of the iguanas were like really bright green and some are kind of a tannish and I think I have a photo I can drop in here of an iguana. Two peacocks on the grounds and they had a couple falcons that the people would walk around and the falcons keep the smaller birds away so they don't disturb people.",
  "offline_reference": "这里有很多蜥蜴和鬣蜥，其中一些鬣蜥呈现出非常鲜亮的绿色，另一些则略带棕褐色，我想我有一张可以在这里分享的鬣蜥照片。园中还有两只孔雀，以及几只由人们带着走动的隼，这些隼用来驱赶小型鸟类，以免它们打扰到游客。"
