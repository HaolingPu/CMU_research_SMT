  "input": "And I understand everybody's negative. Everybody's always negative coming out of Mexico. So that's kind of strange. I mean, I wasn't sure if they were playing fast and loose with the rules or if really nobody tests positive there. I don't know why. I'm just saying it was strange. But we have ways of making things work if they don't work. But we were all quite well. All the staff wore face shields plus a mask, which was really kind of sad out there.",
  "offline_reference": "我理解大家的负面情绪，因为每次从墨西哥出来总是充满抱怨，这有点奇怪，我甚至不确定他们是故意玩忽规则，还是真的没人检测出阳性，我不清楚原因，我只是觉得这事很怪异，但如果我们遇到问题，总有办法解决，不过我们所有人都状态很好，所有工作人员都戴着面罩加护目镜，那场景真是令人感到悲哀。"
